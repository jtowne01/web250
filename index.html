    <p>I am a 21 year old programmer from Charlotte, NC. I do not have a professional background in programming yet, however, I plan on changing that in the near future.</p>      
    <p>Here, you can navigate to my Introduction, Contract, and Brand page. To learn more about me, feel free to navigate over to my <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> page.</p>
    <p>Over these next few months, my website will increasingly be more occupied as I publish assignments or projects.</p>
    <p>Good luck to you all, and I hope everyone has a great semester. Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
